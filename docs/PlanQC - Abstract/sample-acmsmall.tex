\section{Introduction}
Quantum computing, with its capability to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, paves the way for revolution in many fields including such as speeding up factorization in cryptography with Shor's algorithm, enhancing database search efficiency with Grover's algorithm, simulating complex quantum systems for drug discovery. 
%The design and development of new quantum algorithms with their implementation through quantum programming languages, compilers to support languages, debuggers and testing frameworks to test them becomes very important.
With the rise of quantum computing, providing debugging and testing frameworks for quantum programs becomes necessary. It's quite common to make mistakes in programming and things are even worse with quantum programs. Quantum programs behave nondeterministically, on account of the quantum phenomena of superposition and measurement. 
%We are accustomed to the classical way of thinking, writing, debugging, and testing programs. 
In classical debugging, bugs, and issues can be isolated and tested in a deterministic manner, but the probabilistic nature of quantum programs (both in execution and result generation) makes it arduous to isolate or pinpoint errors, and even difficult to set breakpoints and analyze program states at each point of execution. Validating outputs is also a big problem to tackle in quantum programs. This uncertainty amplifies the need for robust debugging tools and better testing frameworks to tackle these programs in a quantum manner.
The power of quantum computing can be used not only to test quantum programs in a quantum manner but also to speed up the testing of classical programs using quantum computers. Quantum testing allows us to use a superposition of all possible test cases as input to Grover's algorithm which searches for inputs under which our software under test gives wrong results, offering a probabilistic approach to verify the correctness of quantum programs. As an initial step, we are building a proof-of-concept prototype that uses Groverâ€™s search algorithm to speed up testing of quantum programs.

\section{Grover's Algorithm}
Leveraging the principle of superposition, our novel testing framework employs Grover's algorithm, a quantum search technique, to efficiently identify input scenarios where the System Under Test (SUT) produces incorrect outcomes. By harnessing the power of Grover's algorithm, we not only speedup the testing process but also enhance the precision of incorrect test case detection. This integration represents a pioneering approach in software testing, merging quantum mechanics with traditional testing paradigms to have a new approach for computational validation. As we delve deeper into this framework, it becomes evident that the fusion of quantum mechanics principles with software testing methodologies can revolutionize the way we perceive and address software reliability and robustness. 

How It Works (Simplified Overview):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialization: Start with a quantum state that is a superposition of all possible states in the system).
    \item Oracle Query: Use a quantum oracle, a black-box operation that marks the incorrect states by flipping the sign of its amplitude.
    \item Amplitude Amplification: After the oracle query, the amplitude of the incorrect state is negative. Grover's algorithm amplifies this amplitude through a process that involves two main steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Inversion About the Mean: Calculate the average amplitude of all states and reflect each amplitude about this average.
        \item Grover Diffusion Operator: This further amplifies the amplitude of the marked state.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Iteration count: steps 2 and 3 are repeated $\sqrt{N}$ times to maximize probability of incorrect states when observed, where 'N' refers to the number of input qubits
    \item Measurement: After the iterations, measure the quantum state. The incorrect state (the solution) will be observed with high probability.
\end{enumerate}
